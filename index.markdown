Hi, I am a research scientist at <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/language/" target="_blank">Google AI Language</a>. I am interested in controllable and interpretable deep neural networks.
My goal is to develop collaborative models that work hand-in-hand with humans to generate text.
Before joining Google, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Harvard, supervised by <a href="http://grosz.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Barbara Grosz</a> and <a href="http://rush-nlp.com/" target="_blank">Sasha Rush</a>. My dissertation, titled "Human-AI Collaboration for Natual Language Generation with Interpretable Neural Networks", can be found <a href="/assets/files/gehrmann_dissertation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

<!-- You can find my full CV <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>. -->
