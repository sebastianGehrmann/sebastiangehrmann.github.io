Hi, I am a research scientist at <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/language/" target="_blank">Google AI Language</a>. My research is focused on the evaluation of neural networks that generate natural language. I want to make generation models controllable, robust, fair, and interpretable.

I like to work on large multi-disciplinary collaborations, for example the <a href="https://gem-benchmark.com/" target="_blank">GEM benchmark</a> for which we are frequently organizing workshops and are looking for participants. Please consider participating!

Before joining Google, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Harvard, supervised by <a href="http://grosz.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Barbara Grosz</a> and <a href="http://rush-nlp.com/" target="_blank">Sasha Rush</a>. My dissertation was titled "<a href="/assets/files/gehrmann_dissertation.pdf" target="_blank">Human-AI Collaboration for Natual Language Generation with Interpretable Neural Networks</a>".
