Hi, I am a research scientist at <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/language/" target="_blank">Google AI Language</a>. My research is focused on developing methods for neural networks that con generate natural language. Specifically, I want to put users of these models first by ensuring that they are controllable, robust, fair, and interpretable.

I like to work on large multi-disciplinary collaborations, for example the <a href="https://gem-benchmark.com/" target="_blank">GEM benchmark</a> for language generation, evaluation, and its metrics for which we are organizing a workshop at ACL 2021. Please consider participating!

Besides this, I also gave a <a href="/assets/files/acl_2020_interpretability_tutorial.pdf" target="_blank">tutorial</a> on interpretability in NLP at ACL 2020, and co-organized a <a href="https://evalnlg-workshop.github.io/" target="_blank">workshop</a> on evaluating NLG models at INLG 2020.

Before joining Google, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Harvard, supervised by <a href="http://grosz.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Barbara Grosz</a> and <a href="http://rush-nlp.com/" target="_blank">Sasha Rush</a>. My dissertation was titled "<a href="/assets/files/gehrmann_dissertation.pdf" target="_blank">Human-AI Collaboration for Natual Language Generation with Interpretable Neural Networks</a>".
